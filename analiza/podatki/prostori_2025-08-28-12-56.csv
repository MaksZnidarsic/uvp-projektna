This space is metrizable, with the standard metric for a discrete space given by $d(x,y)=1$ for $x\ne y$.  A different metric that generates the same topology for $X$ is the Sierpinski metric ($d(x,y)=1+1/(x+y+2)$ for $x\ne y$ in $\omega$) given in counterexample #135 in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9}}.  Since pi-base is meant to model topological properties and not properties of metrics, it only keeps track of topological spaces up to homeomorphism, and thus does not keep a separate entry for the Sierpinski metric.

1) $U=\emptyset$ is open by definition. Let $U = X$ is open by definition.

2) Let $A$ be an arbitrary union of the elements of any subcollection of $\tau$. Since every element in the subcollection are subsets of $X$ their union must be a subset of $X$. Thus, $A$ is a subset of $X$ and is open by definition.

3) Let $A$ be a finite intersection of elements from any subcollection of $\tau$. Since every element in the subcollection are subsets of $X$ their intersection must necessarily be a subset of $X$. Thus, $A$ is a subset of $X$ and is open by definition. -->"

<!-- [[Proof of Topology]]
To prove the first condition, note that $X\in \tau$ by definition. Now, note that $\emptyset \subset X$ and $p\notin \emptyset$. It follows that $\emptyset \in \tau$.
Now to prove the second condition, consider $\bigcup_{i\in I} U_i$ where $I$ is some arbitrary indexing set. It follows that there are two cases, either $p\in \bigcup_{i\in I} U_i$ or $p\notin \bigcup_{i\in I} U_i$. For the case in which $p$ is in the union, it must be the case that $X$ is in the union, because the only open set containing $p$ is $X$. It follows then that the union is $X$. So in this case, the second condition holds. To prove the second case, when $p$ is not in the union, we simply have an arbitrary union of subsets of $X$ which must be a subset of $X$ that does not contain $p$. So, the second condition holds for this case.
To prove the final condition, consider $\bigcap_i^n U_i$. Again, there are two cases here, either $p$ is in the intersection, or it is not. For when $p$ is in the intersection, note that every open set other than $X$ does not contain $p$. So for $p$ to be in the intersection, it must be the case that $X$ is the only set in the intersection and thus it is open. Now if $p$ is not in the intersection, it must be a subset of $X$ that does not contain $p$. So in both cases, the intersection is open, and thus the final condition holds and $\tau$ is a topology on $X$.

----
A purely topological characterization of the space $\mathbb Q$, due to Sierpinski, is given by the following equivalent theorems:
- Every countably infinite, {P53} space without isolated point is homeomorphic to $\mathbb Q$.
- Every countably infinite, {P5}, {P28} space without isolated point is homeomorphic to $\mathbb Q$.

For a proof, see [Countable metric spaces without isolated points (A. Dasgupta)](http://at.yorku.ca/p/a/c/a/25.pdf) or {{doi:10.48550/arXiv.1210.1008}}.
And for the equivalence between the two theorems, the second one easily follows from the first; and the reverse direction follows from {T212} together with Urysohn's metrization theorem.

It follows for example that the following spaces are homeomorphic to $\mathbb Q$.

(1) The space $\mathbb{Z}$ with the **Furstenberg topology**, generated by all sets of

For this deep result due to R. D. Anderson, see for example {{doi:10.1090/S0002-9904-1968-12044-0}}.
Note also that any separable Hilbert space is isomorphic to $\ell^2$.

More generally, any infinite-dimensional separable Banach space or, even more generally, any infinite-dimensional separable Fréchet space is homeomorphic to $\mathbb R^\omega$.

- The subspace of $\ell^2$ consisting of all elements with infinitely many nonzero entries, i.e., $\{\langle x_i \rangle \in \ell^2: x_i \neq 0 \text{ for infinitely many } i\}$, given the subspace topology
- The cone over $\mathbb R^\omega$, i.e., the quotient of $\mathbb R^\omega \times [0, 1]$ with $\mathbb R^\omega \times \{0\}$ identified to a single point
- The open cone over $\mathbb R^\omega$, i.e., the quotient of $\mathbb R^\omega \times [0, \infty)$ with $\mathbb R^\omega \times \{0\}$ identified to a single point
- The unit sphere of any infinite-dimensional separable Banach space, i.e., $\{x \in E: \|x\| = 1\}$ where $E$ is an infinite-dimensional separable Banach space under the norm $\|\cdot\|$, given the topology generated by the metric $d(x,y) = \|x-y\|$; in particular, the unit sphere of $\ell^2$
- The closed unit ball of any infinite-dimensional separable Banach space, i.e., $\{x \in E: \|x\| \leq 1\}$ where $E$ is an infinite-dimensional separable Banach space under the norm $\|\cdot\|$, given the topology generated by the metric $d(x,y) = \|x-y\|$; in particular, the closed unit ball of $\ell^2$

1. Note that $X$ contains all positive integers thus every integer $p$ is in $X$ thus $X$ is open. See that $\emptyset$ contains no integers therefore $\emptyset$ satisfies the condition vacuously therefore it is open.

2. Let $\left\{U_i | i \in I \right\}$ be an arbitrary collection of open sets. Consider any odd $p \in \bigcup\limits_{i \in I} U_i$ since every $U_i$ is open this means $p+1$ is also in the union therefore the union is open.

3. Given any intersection $\bigcap\limits_{n=1}^N U_n$ with $U_n$ an open set and $N \in \mathbb{N}$. Given an odd $p \in \bigcap\limits_{n=1}^N U_n$ then $p \in U_n$ for all $n \leq N$. Thus by definition of open $p+1$ also exists in $U_n$ for all $n \leq N$ therefore $p+1 \in \bigcap\limits_{n=1}^N U_n$ thus $\bigcap\limits_{n=1}^N U_n$ is open. -->"
Cofinite topology on $\omega$ extended by a non-open generic point,S000048,2,2,"Let $X = \omega \sqcup \{p\}$. A nonempty set is open if and only if it contains $p$ and has a finite complement.

$X$ is homeomorphic to the set of prime ideals of the ring $\mathbb{Z}$ with basis consisting of the sets $V_x = \{P \in X : x \notin P\}$ for all $x \in \mathbb{Z}_{n\ge 0}$. The zero ideal identifies with the generic point $p \in X$. This is the Zariski topology on $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$, the prime spectrum of the ring of integers.

To prove the set $\mathscr{B}=\{B_n : n\in X\}$ is a basis for a topology on $X$, we must prove:
$$\text{ For every } x\in X \text{ there exists some } B_n \text{ such that } x\in B_n$$
$$\text{ If }x\in B_a \cap B_b, \text{ there exists some } B_c \text{ such that } x\in B_c\subset B_a\cap B_b$$
To prove the first condition, note that for every $x\in X$, $x$ divides $x$. So by definition, $x \in B_x$.
To prove the second, let $x\in B_a\cap B_b$. It follows that $x\in B_a$ and $x\in B_b$ This is to say, $x$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$. Note that if $x \in B_n$, it follows that $x$ divides $n$. Therefore, all of the divisors of $x$ divide $n$ and thus are in $B_n$. The set $B_x$ is the set of all divisors of $x$, so $x\in B_x \subset B_a\cap B_b$. We have shown that both conditions hold, so therefore the set $\mathscr{B}$ is a basis for topology on $X$.

<!-- [[Proof of Topology]]
A basis for topology on $\mathbb{R}\times \{0,1\}$ is generated by crossing basic open sets of $\mathbb{R}$ with basic open sets of $\{0,1\}$. The basis for the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$ is defined by the set $\mathscr{R}=\{(a,b) : a,b\in \mathbb{R} \text{ and }a<b\}$, where $(a,b)$ is an interval. So, the basis for topology on the Double Pointed Reals is defined by the set $\mathscr{B}=\{A\times \{0,1\}:A\in \mathscr{R}\}$. More simply, $\mathscr{B}=\{(c,d) : c\in\mathscr{R},d\in\{0,1\}$, where $(c,d)$ is an ordered pair. In a sense, the Double Pointed Reals Topology is like keeping parallel copies of the standard topology on $\mathbb{R}$; one mapped to 0 and one mapped to 1.
To prove the set $\mathscr{B}$ is a basis for a topology on $\mathbb{R}\times\{0,1\}$, we must prove
$$\text{ For every } x\in X \text{ there exists some } B_n \text{ such that } x\in B_n$$
$$\text{ If }x\in B_a \cap B_b, \text{ there exists some } B_c \text{ such that } x\in B_c\subset B_a\cap B_b$$
So to prove the first condition, let $x\in \mathbb{R}\times \{0,1\}$. This implies $x$ is of the form $(x,0) \text{ or } (x,1)$. Suppose $x$ is of the form $(x,0)$. Let $A$ be some interval $(a,b)$ that contains $x$. It is obvious that $x$ belongs to the ordered pair $(A,0)$. A similar argument follows for the case when $x$ is of the form $(x,1)$.
To prove the second condition, let $x\in B_1\cap B_2$. This implies $B_1 \text{ and } B_2$ have the same component of the set $\{0,1\}$.  Furthermore, the first element in the ordered pair of $B_1$ and $B_2$ are both of the form $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ respectively such that $x\in (a,b) \text{ and } (c,d)$. Construct a new interval of the form, $(\text{max}(a,c),\text{min}(b,d))$. It follows that $x$ is in this interval, and $x$ is in the basic open set $B_3$ with the first element as $(\text{max}(a,c),\text{min}(b,d))$ and the second element the same as $B_1$ and $B_2$. Both 1 and 2 hold, so the Double Pointed Reals is a basis topology.
