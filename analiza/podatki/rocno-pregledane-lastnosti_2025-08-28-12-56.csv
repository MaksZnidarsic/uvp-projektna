If $U_n = X\setminus \{x_m : m\geq n\}$ then the sequence $(U_n)$ is increasing, consists of open sets, and $\bigcup_n U_n = X$. If $A$ were relatively compact then there would be $n$ for which $A\subseteq U_n$. But $x_n\in A\setminus U_n$ so that's impossible.

Any totally-ordered set is clearly this, so we consider when $p$ is one of the points in question.  That is, let $q$ be a point on the long line and $p$ the special point added.  Let $r$ be the least ordinal greater than $q$.  Define the function $f:X\to [0,1]$ as follows for $t\le q$, define $f(q)=0$.  Now note that $[q, r]$ is homeomorphic with $[0,1]$, so for $q \le t \le r$, let $f(t)$ be such a homeomorphism with $f(q)=0$ and $f(r)=1$.  Then define $f(t)=1$ for $t > r$ or $t=p$.

The set $U = \bigl( \left[ 0, 1 \right] \cap \mathbb Q \bigr) \times (0, 1)$ is an $F_\sigma$ open set in $X$, therefore a cozero set, since {S41|P13} (see Corollary 1.5.13 in {{zb:0684.54001}}).

Suppose $V$ is a cozero set disjoint from $U$ such that $U \cup V$ is dense.
Let $A := \operatorname{int}(X \setminus U) = \bigl( \left[ 0, 1 \right] \setminus \mathbb Q \bigr) \times (0, 1)$.
Then we have $V \subseteq A \subseteq \operatorname{cl} V$.

Let $p \colon X \to [0, 1]$ be the projection mapping to the first coordinate. Then $p(V) = \left[ 0, 1 \right] \setminus \mathbb Q$.

Write $V = \bigcup_{n \in \omega} F_n$ where $F_n$ is closed in $X$, then $p(V) = \bigcup_{n \in \omega} p(F_n)$. So there is at least one $F_n$ such that $p(F_n)$ is infinite; thus $p(F_n)$ contains an accumulation point $r \in [0, 1]$.

$X$ is LindelÃ¶f: let $\left\{U_i, i \in I\right\}$ be a basic open cover of $X$. There are two cases:

1: One of the $U_i$ has countable complement, then we only need countably many extra $U_j$ to cover all of $X$, and so we find a countable subcover, or

2: All $U_i$ are standard Euclidean open sets. But then we can use that $\mathbb{R}$ in the usual topology is LindelÃ¶f (as it's second countable e.g.) to see that we again have a countable subcover.

To show $X$ is {P36}, suppose by contradiction that $X=A\cup B$ is a partition of $X$ into open subsets, with $a<b$, $a\in A$, $b\in B$.
Then $x:=\inf(B\cap(a,+\infty) ) \ge a$. Considering the base for the topology one can observe that an open set cannot contain its infimum, hence $x\in A$. Then $[a,x+\varepsilon)\cap\mathbb Q\subset A$ for some $\varepsilon >0$, implying $A=\overline{A}\supset [a,x+\varepsilon]$
and contradicting the definition of $x$.

And every $x\in X$ is a cut point, since the two open sets $(-\infty,x)$ and $(x,+\infty)$ partition $X\setminus \{x\}$.

We will use Ishikawa's characterization of {P33}.

Let $q_0, q_1, \dots$ be an enumeration of the rational numbers $\mathbb Q$.
Define $F_n := \{ q_i \mid i > n \}$.
Each $F_n$ is closed in $X$ and the $F_n$ are nested with empty intersection.
Moreover, $F_n$ is dense in $\mathbb R$ with respect to the usual Euclidean topology.

Note that the subspace topology on $D=\mathbb R\setminus\mathbb Q$ coincides with the Euclidean topology induced from $\mathbb R$.
So the subspace $D$ is exactly {S28}.

Now, suppose $U_n$ is an open set containing $F_n$.
The intersection $U_n \cap D$ is open in $D$ and it is easy to check it is dense in $D$.


Since {S28|P64}, $\bigcap_{n \in \omega} (U_n \cap D)\ne\varnothing$,
and hence $\bigcap_{n \in \omega}U_n\ne\varnothing$.
This proves that the space is not {P33}.

The open subset $\mathbb Q{\times}\{0\}$ is homeomorphic to a metrizable space $\mathbb Q$.

Consider $(x,y)\in X$ with $y>0$. Observe that for $0<\epsilon<y/\theta$ the open neighbourhood $N_\epsilon(x,y)$ is homeomorphic to the following subset of $\mathbb R^2$ (hence it is metrizable):
$\big(B(-y/\theta,\epsilon){\times}\{y/ \theta\}\big)
\cup \big(\{-y/ \theta\}{\times} B(y/ \theta,\epsilon)\big)\cup
\big\{(-y/ \theta,y/ \theta)\big\}$,

Following the terminology used in {{zb:1453.54006}}, a set
$A\subset X$ is called *$\theta$-discrete* if every point of $X$ has a closed neighbourhood containing only one point of $A$. (The symbol ""$\theta$"" here has nothing to do with the irrational constant used to define {S67}.)

By Theorem 1 in that paper, every bijection between $\theta$-discrete subsets of $X$ extends to a homeomorphism from $X$ to itself.

The set $\mathbb Z\times\{0\}$ is $\theta$-discrete (every discrete closed subset contained in $\mathbb Q\times\{0\}$ is) and admits continuum many bijections to itself (e.g. every subset of $Z$ with at least two elements in its complement can be the set of fixed points).
Hence there exist uncountably many self-homeomorphisms of $X$.

Suppose $A\cup B = X\setminus\{x\}$ for some $x\in X$ and disjoint nonempty open sets $A, B\subset X$ (note that {S67|P2}).
In particular $\overline{A} \cap \overline{B}\subset (X\setminus B)\cap (X\setminus A)= \{x\}$,
but the closures of any two nonempty open sets in $X$ have _infinite_ intersection
(see item #2 for space #75 in {{doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-6290-9_6}}).
Hence $X\setminus\{x\}$ is {P36} implying that $x$ is not a cut point.

If $d:X^2\to[0,+\infty)$ was a symmetric generating the topology, then for every $x\in\mathbb R$ there would exist $r_x>0$ such that $B_d((x,0),r_x)\subseteq \mathbb R\times\{0\}$.
Let $A_n:=\{x\in\mathbb R: r_x>1/n\}$.
Since $\mathbb R = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n$ is uncountable, so is $A_m$ for some $m\geq 1$.

An uncountable subset of $\mathbb R$ has an accumulation point (cf. {{mathse:310113}}), hence there exists a sequence of distinct values $(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty\subset A_m$ such that $a_n\to a\in \mathbb R$.
Let $S:=\overline{\{(a_n,0):n\in\mathbb N\}}=\{(a_n,0):n\in\mathbb N\}\cup\{(a,0),(a,1)\}$ and $S_0:=S\setminus\{(a,1)\}$.
Since $S$ is closed, every point $u\in X\setminus S$ satisfies $d(u,S_0)\ge d(u,S)>0$.
By definition of $A_m$, we also have $d((a_n,0),(a,1))\geq 1/m$, hence hence $d((a,1),S_0)>0$.
Since every point not in $S_0$ has a positive distance to $S_0$, $S_0$ is closed, which is a contradiction.

We can construct a $G_\delta$-diagonal sequence $\mathscr U_1,\mathscr U_2, \dots$ by letting
$\mathscr U_n=\{B(\langle x,1\rangle,1/n):x\in\mathbb R\}$, where

$\quad B(\langle x,1\rangle,\frac1n)=\{\langle x,1\rangle\}\cup\big(((x-\frac1n,x)\cup(x,x+\frac1n))\times\{0\}\big)$

is a basic open neighborhood around the point
$\langle x,1\rangle$ in the top line as described in the definition of the space.

Each $\mathscr U_n$ is an open cover of $X$.
One easily checks that for a point $\langle x,1\rangle$ in the top line,
$\operatorname{st}(\langle x,1\rangle,\mathscr U_n)=B(\langle x,1\rangle,\frac1n)$;
and for a point $\langle x,0\rangle$ in the bottom line,
$\operatorname{st}(\langle x,0\rangle,\mathscr U_n)\subseteq((x-\frac2n,x+\frac2n)\times\{0,1\})
\setminus\{\langle x,1\rangle\}$.
From there it follows that 
$\bigcap_n\operatorname{st}(\langle x,i\rangle,\mathscr U_n)=\{\langle x,i\rangle\}$
for all $\langle x,i\rangle\in X$.

Case one both a and b are on $C_1$ thus if we find the radial distance from a to b on $C_1$ and then take half the distance and call that distance $\epsilon$ the create $V_{\epsilon}(a)$ and $V_{\epsilon}(b)$ these two sets are disjoint and and open on $C_1$ when also projected onto $C_2$.
Case two a is on $C_1$ and b is the radial projection of a onto $C_2$. find any open set on $C_1 $ where a is the midpoint and the set containing b on $C_2$ these two sets are disjoint and open.
Case three a is on $C_1$ and b is not the radial midpoint of a onto $C_2$. first we find the pre-image j of b in $C_1$ find the radial distance between a and j then multiply that by two and call that $\epsilon$ the take the epsilon neighborhood around j and the set containing b on $C_2$ these are two disjoint open sets containing a and b respectively.
Case four both a and b are on $C_2$ this is trivial and just take the sets only conaining a and b respectively.
Therefore the concentric circles Topology is $T_2$.

Now given any point a in $O_A$, a has an open set $U_a$ which is disjoint from B and can be chosen such that $U_a \cap C_1 \subset U_A$ and similarly for any point b in $B \cap C_1$ we can find a disjoint open set $U_b$ from $A$ and $U_b \cap C_1 \subset U_B$. Now since $A \cap C_2$ and $B \cap C_2$ are open we can get open sets $(A \cap C_2) \cup (\bigcup\limits_{a \in A} U_a)$ and $(B \cap C_2) \cup (\bigcup\limits_{b \in B} U_b)$ which are disjoint and contain $A$ and $B$ respectively.

To prove the concentric circles is compact then it is sufficient to prove that $C_1$ is Compact. We know that $C_1 \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ thus by the Heine-Borel Theorem of Higher Order Reals we must only show that $C_2$ is closed and bounded in $\mathbb{R}^2$. To show $C_1$ is bounded we can see that the distance from $(0,0)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is equal to $1$ thus $C_1$ is bounded by $1$. To show that $C_1$ is closed it is enough to show that the complement of $C_1$ is open thus we will construct the complement of $C_1$ since $C_1 = \left\{x \in \mathbb{R}^2 : |x| = 1 \right\}$ thus

$C_1 {}^c = \left\{x \in \mathbb{R}^2 : |x| < 1 \right\} \cup \left\{x \in \mathbb{R}^2 : |x| > 1 \right\}$

which are open sets in $\mathbb{R}^2$ therefore $C_1$ is compact. Thus the Concentric Circles Topology is compact.

We will prove that for each $x \in [0,1]$ there doesn't exist countable base at point $(x,x)$. Let's assert opposite, that is, that there exists $x \in [0,1]$ such that there exists countable base $\mathcal{B}=\{B_{n}:n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ at point $(x,x)$. For each $n \in \mathbb{N}$ let $A_{n}= \{x_{0},\dots ,x_k\}$ where $B_n=\{(t,y) \in X: |y-x|<\epsilon , t \notin \{x_0,\dots,x_k\}\}$. Let $A=\bigcup\limits_{n \in \mathbb{N}}A_n$. Then $cardA\leq\aleph_0$.
Suppose $z \in [0,1]$ is an arbitrary element.Then $U=([0,1]\setminus z)\times[0,1]$ is an open set which contains $(x,x)$. So there exists $B \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $ (x,x) \in B \subseteq U$.That implies $z\notin B$ so it must be $z \in A_n\subseteq A$. We conclude $[0,1]\subseteq A$,but that is contradiction with $card[0,1]=\mathfrak{c}>cardA=\aleph_0$.

That is, $V$ is a product of subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^+$ which is all of $\mathbb{Z}^+$ in all but finitely many coordinates.  Let $\alpha$ be one of the coordinates where $V$ is all of $\mathbb{Z}^+$ in that coordinate.  Then define for each $n\in \mathbb{Z}^+$ $A_n$ to be the set of all $u\in U$ such that $u_\alpha=n$.  Then we see that the collection $\{A_n\}$ is a covering of $U$ which has no finite subcovering, hence $U$ is not compact.

Let $x\in I^I$ and let $\mathcal{B}$ be a countable collection of open neighborhoods of $x$.  Since each neighborhood is allowed to be a proper subset of $I$ in only finitely many coordinates, it follows that there are only countably many coordinates where some element of $\mathcal{B}$ misses a point of $I$ in that coordinate.  Let $j$ be a coordinate where this does not happen.  Such a $j$ is guaranteed to exist since there are uncountably many coordinates.  Then let $a < x_j < b$ be such that not both of $a=0$ and $b=1$ are true.  (Also, we must allow for $a=x_j$ or $b=x_j$ in the cases where $x_j=0$ or $x_j=1$ respectively.)  Then the open set $U$ which is $I$ in every coordinate $i\ne j$ but $(a,b)$ in the $j$-coordinate contains no element of $\mathcal{B}$, thus $\mathcal{B}$ cannot be a local basis at $x$.

The point $\omega_0\times 0$ has no connected neighborhood.  Indeed, let $U$ be an open neighborhood of $\omega_0\times 0$.  Then $U$ contains a set of the form $(a,b)\times V$, with $a < \omega_0 < b$.  Let $A=([0,a+2)\times I^I)\cap U$ and $B=((a+1,\Omega)\times I^I)\cap U$.  Each is open since it is the intersection of two open sets.  They are clearly disjoint, and $U=A\cup B$, so they form a separation of $U$, hence $U$ is not connected.  

It is noted that this works replacing $\omega_0$ with any limit ordinal and relies only on the fact that $[0,\Omega)$ is not locally connected.

Then, for every $g\in X$, $d(f,g) \geq \frac{1}{2}(f(y)-f(x))$ and so $f$ admits an open neighbourhood in $I^I\setminus X$.

Let $K \subset X$ be compact. If $K$ contains infinitely many elements of $M$, then $\{\omega \cup \{F\}: F \in M \cap K\}$ is an open cover with no finite subcover. Thus, $K$ contains finitely many elements of $M$, which we can list as $F_1, \cdots, F_n$.

Now, suppose $K$ contains infinitely many elements of $\omega$. We inductively choose $A_i \in F_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$ as follows: We let $B_1=\omega\cap K$ and shall choose our inductive assumption as $B_i = (\omega \cap K) \setminus (A_1 \cup \cdots \cup A_{i-1})$ being infinite. Write $B_i = C_i \cup D_i$ for two infinite, disjoint $C_i$ and $D_i$. If $C_i \in F_i$, let $A_i = C_i$. Otherwise, let $A_i = \omega \setminus C_i$, which necessarily belongs to $F_i$. We note that, either way, $B_{i+1} = B_i \setminus A_i$ is infinite.

Thus, $B_{n+1} = (\omega \cap K) \setminus (A_1 \cup \cdots \cup A_n)$ is infinite and $\{A_i \cup \{F_i\}\}_{i=1}^n \cup \{\{x\}: x \in B_{n+1}\}$ is an open cover of $K$ with no finite subcover, also a contradiction. Hence, $K$ can contain only finitely many elements of $M$ and only finitely many elements of $\omega$, so $K$ is finite.

Let $p,q\in X$ be two consecutive local maxima on the graph of $f(x)=\sin(1/x)$.
The loop $L\subseteq X$ consisting of the line segment between $p$ and $q$ and the portion of the graph of $f$ below it is homeomorphic to a circle $S^1$.
Hence $\pi_1(L)$ is non-trivial, since {S170|P200}.

Its interior in $X$ is then {P55} as well.

Let $Y$ be any subset of Cantor's Teepee containing more than one point. Our goal is to produce two sets $A$ and $B$ such that

*  $A$ and $B$ are separated open sets in the subspace topology induced by $Y$, and
*  $Y = A \cup B$.

Since Cantor's Teepee is itself a subspace of the usual topology on $\mathbb{R}^2$, we may revise these conditions to read

*  $A$ and $B$ are separated open sets in the usual topology on $\mathbb{R}$, and
*  $Y \subseteq A \cup B$.

Now, suppose $Y$ contains points $p \in X_a$ and $q \in X_c$ with $a \neq c$ (that is, $Y$ witnesses more than one ""strand"" of the teepee). Choose any real number $b$ such that $a < b < c$ and $b$ lies in a deleted interval of the Cantor set. To obtain the separated open sets $A$ and $B$, take any open set containing $Y$ (or even the entire teepee) and ""split"" it along the line connecting $(b,0)$ and $(1/2,1/2)$ (see figure).

Suppose instead that all points of $Y$ belong to a single strand. The $y$-coordinates of points belonging to this strand are either all rational or all irrational. In either case, we can easily separate the strand by passing our open sets through a point $r$ with $y$-coordinate of the opposite type (see figure).

Define $h:X\to[0,+\infty)$ as $h(x)=\frac{1}{\|x\|}-1$ and $r:X\to \mathbb S^1$ as $r(x):=\frac{1}{\|x\|}x$. These are clearly continuous maps on $X$ (the topology is finer than Euclidian). Then consider a metric $d$ given by:
- $d(p,q)=|h(p)-h(q)|$, if $r(p)=r(q)$;
- $d(p,q)=h(p)+h(q)+\|r(p)-r(q)\|$, otherwise.

Symmetry and reflexivity of $d$ is immediate. Triangle inequality requires consideration of few cases but is elementary as well.

By continuity of $r$ and $h$ we obtain that convergence in the topology on $X$ implies convergence with respect to $d$.

Assume $d(x_n,x)\to 0$ for some $x\in X$ and $(x_n)\subset X$. If $h(x)>0$, then clearly $r(x_n)=r(x)$ for sufficeintly large $n$ and $\|x_n\|\to \|x\|$,
implying convergence $x_n \to x$ in $X$.
For $h(x)=0$, we have $h(x_n)\to 0$ and $r(x_n)\to r(x)=x$ in the Euclidean topology. But since $x$ inherits Euclidean Neihgbourhoods we obtain convergence $x_n\to x$ in this case as well.
Hence $d$ is indeed a metric providing the topology on $X$.

To prove completeness of $d$, observe that
a Cauchy sequence $(x_n)\subset X$ with respect to $d$ either satisfies $h(x_n)\to 0$ or is eventually contained in one of the
open radii. Since any radius (i.e. $(0,1]\cdot p$ with $p\in \mathbb S^1$) is isometric with $[0,+\infty)$, a Cauchy sequence contained therein has a limit.
Now focus on the case $h(x_n)\to 0$. Clearly,
also $(r(x_n))$ has to be a Cauchy sequence.
Since Euclidean metric on $\mathbb S^1$ is complete, there exists $z:=\lim_{n\to \infty} r(x_n)$. Since also $h(x_n)\to 0$, we obtain
$d(x_n,z)\to 0$, which ends the proof.

Since $V$ is a cozero set, write $V = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty F_n$ where $F_n$ are closed. Then $\infty\notin F_n$ so $F_n$ is finite. It follows that $V$ is countable.

Otherwise, $a=\left<a_0,\dots,a_{m-1},a_m,0,0,\dots\right>$ with $a_m$ the last non-zero value.
Take an increasing sequence $b_1<b_2<\dots$ in $[0,1]$ converging to $a_m$ and define
$$x^{(n)}=\left<a_0,\dots,a_{m-1},b_n,0,0,\dots\right>\in(\leftarrow,a).$$
The sequence $(x^{(n)})_n$ is increasing and converges to $a$.

Similarly, given a point $a\ne\max X$,
one can find an decreasing sequence of points $y^{(n)}\in X$ converging to $a$.

So for $a\notin\{\min X,\max X\}$, the countably many intervals
$(x^{(n)},y^{(n)})$ form a local base at $a$.  And for $a\in\{\min X,\max X\}$
one can use the intervals $[a,y^{(n)})$ or $(x^{(n)},a]$.

(similar to {S41|P61})

Since {S212|P28},
every open interval $(z,w)\subseteq X$ is an $F_\sigma$ set.
For $a\in[0,1]$, let  $I_a$ denote the open interval
from $\left<a,0,0,\dots\right>$ to $\left<a,1,1,\dots\right>$, which is therefore an $F_\sigma$ set.
The set $U=\bigcup\{I_a:a\in[0,1]\cap\mathbb Q\}$ is an open $F_\sigma$ set,
hence a cozero set since {S212|P13}
(see Corollary 1.5.13 in {{zb:0684.54001}}).

Suppose by contradiction $V$ is a cozero set disjoint from $U$ with $U\cup V$ dense in $X$.
Necessarily, $V\cap I_a\ne\varnothing$ for $a\in[0,1]\setminus\mathbb Q$.
And $V\cap\overline I_a=\varnothing$ for $a\in[0,1]\cap\mathbb Q$.
So if $\pi:X\to[0,1]$ is the projection onto the $0$-th coordinate,
$\pi(V)=[0,1]\setminus\mathbb Q$.
Since every cozero set is an $F_\sigma$ set, $V=\bigcup_n F_n$ for some closed sets $F_n$,
and $\pi(V)=\bigcup_n\pi(F_n)$.
So there is at least one $F_n$ with $\pi(F_n)$ infinite; this $\pi(F_n)$ contains an accumulation point $r \in [0, 1]$.
Then either $u=\left<r,0,0,\dots\right>\in F_n\subseteq V$ or $v=\left<r,1,1,\dots\right>\in F_n\subseteq V$.
But any neighborhood of a point like $u$ or $v$ contains $I_a$ for some $a\in\mathbb Q$, so $V\cap U\ne\varnothing$.
This contradiction shows that $X$ is not {P61}.

$X$ contains the closed subspace
$\bigl( (0, 1] \times \{0\}^\omega \bigr) \cup \bigl( [0, 1) \times \{1\}^\omega \bigr)$,
which is homeomorphic to {S93}
(by the map sending $\left<x_0,x_1,x_2,\dots\right>$ to $\left<x_0,x_1\right>$).

{S93|P76}, so neither is $X$
since the {P76} property is hereditary with respect to closed sets.

Let $x$ be any point and let $U$ be a neighborhood of $x$.  Let $V\subset U$ be a basic open set.  That is, $V$ is a product of subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^+$ which is all of $\mathbb{Z}^+$ in all but finitely many coordinates.  Let $\alpha$ be one of the coordinates where $V$ is all of $\mathbb{Z}^+$ in that coordinate.  Then define for each $n\in \mathbb{Z}^+$ $A_n$ to be the set of all $u\in U$ such that $u_\alpha=n$.  Then we see that the collection $\{A_n\}$ is a covering of $U$ which has no finite subcovering, hence $U$ is not compact.
